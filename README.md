<h1>2048 Game implementation using C++</h1>
<h2>This is a simple and easy implementation of 2048 game using a 2d array.</h2>
<p>One can easily understand the logic behind its implementation. Here both rows and coloums are treated as same entities and logic is defined accordingly no seperate logic is created for rows and coloumns or for up,down,left or right movement.</p>

<p>Here the main logic is defined for right movement and other movements are edited accordingly as shown in diagram.</p>
